## Questions

### Comments

* How to access comments, when someone is not logged in?
  * People without logging in cannot see comments therefore?
* One file with all comments, or one container with a file per comment?

### Conference Registration

* Own ontology
* Custom fields, where I don't know what the type of data is going to be.

## Notes

* “Rewrites are the death of Solid”
* one file per comment
* private event
  * container is not public
  * put the link on the private event
  * items are only with
  * public comments
* create namespace event specific, namespaced to this event
* under the event public
* you look at the pod and try
* new conf login with WebId, can I get access to the pod, to specific data
* store conference data in general

* encryption
* replications
* data formats
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
