# 2021/05/05 Maria Michiel

*Present: Maria, Michiel, Jan*

## Notes

* Future server implementations for CERN
  * integrate with CERNbox, high risk
    * all files in there: great but also scary

  * sandboxed CSS: isolated server, hosted by server, given to employees, single sign-on with CERNAuth
  * outstanding solution: solidcommunity.net, see how it evolves, add value to user

*Michiel*:
>Cautious option: keep using solidcommunity.net. Medium: set up on-prem CSS with SSI integration. Utopia: Enable a Solid-Cernbox app (based on the Solid-Nextcloud app) on cernbox (integrating both identity and storage).

* not enough Solid apps for CERN to be interested in Solid
* TrinPod, DexPod extra server features not based from spec
* Open collection to support the development of the independent test-suite
