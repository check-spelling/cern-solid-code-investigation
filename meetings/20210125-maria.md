*Present: Maria, Jan*

* Brainstorm pros and cons of a client- or server-side approach of the proof of concept
* Talk with Adrian in this regards
* Think about a comment from the White Area discussion: "The fact that data on Solid servers are not encrypted and the NSS is hosted in the USA and on AWS etc is a good reason for CERN to host our users' pods"
