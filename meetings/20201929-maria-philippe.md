# 2020/10/21 Meeting

*Present: Maria, Philippe, Jan*

- Clarified that the current project has enough academic value for ITU.
- The previous step 4 (developing POC) is now done before, this is because the previous step 3 (comparing CERN application design principles with Solid approaches) is a investigative task and better suited for the thesis next semester.
- Next meeting with Maria and Philippe end of November to talk about presentation, making sure still on track for this project and making sure that research project and thesis are both self-contained.
- Presenting at Solid World the CERN-Solid collaboration by talking about the code investigation.
