# 2020/09/28 Maria

- For every milestone send draft of report to Maria
- Reserve either the 14th or 15th of October for a meeting with Adrian (Chief Engineer at Indico) to talk about the architecture of Indico and technical aspects needed for M3â€“M5. This is to take advantage of being able to talk to someone, who knows the software instead of trying to figure it out alone.
