\subsubsection{Commenting Module for Events in Indico}\mbox{}\\

For the first \gls{poc} some sort of Solid-based content was planned to be enriched into the Indico system. With the product owner and chief developer of Indico, the CERN-Solid project manager and a Solid developer it was decided a commenting module for Indico events is an adequate solution to include data from an external storage entity namely a Solid pod. The ability to allow users of Indico to leave a comment on an event, which then lives in a Solid pod completely controlled by the author of the comment was concluded to be an attractive feature for Indico.

\paragraph{Design}\mbox{}\\

For the implementation of this module several design decisions had to be made.

\subparagraph{Client- vs. Server-Side}\mbox{}\\

The module can either handle most of its functionality on the client-side, meaning on the agentâ€™s device, which is browsing to the Indico event where the comment module is integrated or it could be handled on the server-side. This would mean most of the work, such as for example communication with a Solid pod is being done by the server in the running instance of Indico.
