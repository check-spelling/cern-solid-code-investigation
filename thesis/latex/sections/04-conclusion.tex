* “you will get back to the problem definition and summarize what you have done”

* plug and play does not work so good, closer to Indico -> Indico proxy

* Solid lives through the community, when only one company does the implementation it will not thrive
* vicious cycle
* 

Solid from the community, for everyone
start by the community
get going, but breakthrough takes more -> CERN

community <-> company
not just one company it won't thrive

software needs to be rethought
major challenges:
    usability
    performance
    describing the world in Linked Data, can the data of the complex world be described for by machines?
it takes entities as CERN to not let commercial companies built the products, otherwise Solids futures might be at stake? (a bit harsh)

solid is still experimental and needs a lot of attention from developers
startups are good
the more the merrier
the community needs to remain as a driver
high profile people help, but cannot be the motivator

build better and hybrid products for people where they might not even realize the decentralized benefits

challenge the known
