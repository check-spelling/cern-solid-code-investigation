I want to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor from CERN, Maria Dimou. Over the last nine months, I have learned beyond the content of this thesis; I would be incapable of putting the insights from these attainments into writing. I have enjoyed our weekly supervision meetings, which had often drifted from the planned agenda into exchanges over life beyond our solar system, the philosophy of ancient Greeks, intuitionism in mathematics, challenges in learning the German language, political decisions in tumultuous times, and much more. Thank you for teaching me so much; I will miss the weekly chat undoubtedly, but I am sure it is no goodbye.
