\section{Challenges, Advantages, and Gaps of Existing Solid Solutions versus CERN Ones}

\subsection{Lack of Solid Applications}

\subsection{Encryption at Rest}

\subsection{User Interface}

\subsection{Commercial and Open-Source Solutions}



* 
* Encryiption -> hosting on premise
* Hosting on premise -> high involvement with the servers
* Solid UI challenges
* Commercial and open-source not perfectly hand in hand
* Not many applications in Solid ecosystem
    * no sophisticated to say the least
    * the closest LiqidChat makes heavy use of an API
