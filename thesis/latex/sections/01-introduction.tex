\section{Context}

The Web was created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN “\textelp{} to allow people to work together by combining their knowledge in a web of hypertext documents” \cite{timbl-bio}. This brilliant idea has ever since grown as an essential part of our all lives. While bringing a new platform for innovation into existence, a new level of oppression and surveillance that has never been seen before has facilitated without most even realizing. Through whistle blowing, active journalism, and technical education a new wave of hope is arising in the ocean of data management. Not giving up on the Web, which has in its little over 30 years of lifetime proven its paramount act in state, society, and the economy, Sir Tim has an adjustment for the Web specified. With the help of several Web enthusiasts, companies, and even governments the idea of Solid was found.


While it has given a new platform for all types of innovation, it has also evolved away from the initial idea of sharing knowledge freely.
