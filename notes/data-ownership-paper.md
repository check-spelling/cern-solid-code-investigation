# Notes for Data ownership and interoperability for a decentralized social semantic web

* Identity and identification [p4]
  * Identify something in a uniform manner: URI as global identifier.
  * URIs can return a useful description of what it identifies.
  * Identification the process of establishing once identity.
  * Persistent identity over decentralized service: WebID + WebID-TLS.
* Interoperability on the web [p5]
  * To offer true interoperability in the web a new standard is needed. There is no incentive to share data between web services, therefore, no widely adopted API to do so.
  * **The Semantic Web**
* Semantic Web [p5]
  * RDF and Turtle format to let the computer understand the resources and its relationship
  * RDF is about making statements about resources in form subject-predicate-object expressions (triples)
* WebID
  * HTTP URI uniquily
