## Abstract

* "Users' data is managed independetly of the applications that create and consume this data."
* "Users store their data in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (pod)."
* "Users can have multiple pods and easily switch between them."
* "Applications access the data using defined protocols."
* "Decentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantee privacy of the data."
* "Applications can operate on users' data where it is stored."
* "Users access the control the data."

## Summary of paper

Social Web applications store the users' data on their own server, provide own authentication service and access control mechanism and developers are restricted to the data access APIs provided by these companies. This architecture does not allow the user to switch easily platforms, use a single authentication service, reuse the data they have put onto the Web. Further, the developers creating applications do not have a decentralized access to this data.
