# Useful information from Gitter chat

A lot of valuable information is being shared on Gitter, an internet relay chat (IRC). Gitter does not offer a great search interface, making the search for specific information difficult.

This document is a collection of message that I found useful. Please always take into account that the information could be outdated or not entirely correct. Refer to accepted technical documentation or to the people directly to gather reliable information.

>Most Solid server implementations consist of many smaller modules. For instance the IDP in NSS is based on Anvil. The one in inrupt-pod-server was based on panva's oidc library. I think the one in ess-broker is based on Mitre. The one in php-solid-server and in Nextcloud is based on phpleague/OAuth. TrinPod also has an IDP component. CSS does not (yet).
