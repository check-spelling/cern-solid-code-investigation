Some transcribed questions and answers

Subsequent access
ACL side

Question 1

Solid pod concept
1. Privacy is data encrypted?
No
Good tool to make sure some people can access the data, and others can't
Trouble with the keys, regular users cannot lose their keys
Solid on the web principles: Distributed linked system
URL determines who controls the data and who can see it and host it
HTTPS encryption
use of domain names

=> CERN as a provider for pods
=> Trust at some point, and take it home

2. Robustness, a pod self-contained unit. Possible to replicate pods?

Not on the level of the Solid protocols
Multiple copies of the data on top of Solid and under
Solid server with backups
RDF Linked Data gives tools with notations saying this is a copy of this
Server stays up at the URL, you can do that by hosting it redundantly

Question 2

subsequent access, acl part
conference side
next years conference
want to mail out to same people
all the people from the previous conference
if they allow to mail out
Solid, can only be known by this conference

Solid is control (forever)
How do people query and ask for access at a later stage

Proactive from the provider, you as a data owner know nothing about, unless you had a chance of saying yes/no on the conference

General:
Supermarket has lots of data about you
Don't share with the gas company
Supermarket stores it in the pod
Gas company wants to know whats in your fridge
Biliteral relationship with your supermarket
and then new biliteral relationship with gas company
and you then as subject and owner give access to the gas company and giving consent
better than supermarket and gas company being the ones sharing personal data

putting the data to the user, who is the central part makes these exchanges easier, for that the user controls the data and can directly decide on consent, besides than triangular relationships

Flow:
  doctor: did he eat this last night, is that because he is ill?
  how does he know what supermarket I go to?
  how does he know what I ate?

  no good flow, where it is initiated by the receiver of the data
  send notification, prompts you to log in, where you then see that your doctor wants to see what you ate last night

  user has to initiate sharing the data, they just come up in your inbox, which you can ignore or handle

  requests can be sent speculatively

  the flow that makes things happened, but does not give access.
