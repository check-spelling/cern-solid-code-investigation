## Overview

1. Solid and CERN
2. Status of this Project
3. Perspectives for Future Work

---

## CERN-Solid Code Investigation

Finding suitable areas at CERN to justify an implementation of the Solid principles

---

## Solid Principles

* True ownership of data
* Move data freely
* Access policies controlled by users

---

## Solid Pod

* Web server handling requests
* Linked Data for data representation
* Personal data store
* Decentralized authentication with Solid OpenID Connect

---

## Why Is CERN Interested?

* Birthplace of the Web
* Distribution of knowledge freely
* Has many sophisticated open source projects

---

## The Status of the Specifications

* Still work in progress
* Expected finish by end of June 2021
* Primer and best-practices documents are lacking

---

## Existing Implementations

* CSS is promising
* Solid apps are lacking
* Pod for every citizen in Flanders
* British health care system on Solid

---

## Current Status of the Project

1. **Review Solid specifications**
2. **Evaluate Solid implementations**
3. *Enrich Indico with Solid principles*
4. Recommendations on Solid adoption in CERN applications
5. Document challenges, advantages, gaps
6. Presentation of proceedings

## Perspectives on this Project

* Develop a *proof of concept*
* Client or server-side?
* JavaScript or Python?
