## What Is Solid

* Sir Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL) announced his Solid project (Social Linked Data) in 2016.
* This Open Source platform aims to re-decentralize the Web and empower users' control over their own data.
* Solid includes standards, missing from the original Web specifications, giving back to the users:
    *  _ownership_ of their _data_, private, shared, and public.
    *  _choice_ on the _storage_ where these data reside and
    *  _control_ over who has _access_ to them.
* TimBL co-founded [inrupt](https://inrupt.com) to implement the Solid standards.

---

## The Solid Pod

* People store their data securely in decentralized data stores called _Pods_. (*)
* Pods are like secure personal Web servers for data.
* Solid connects resources in different pods by representing all data as _Linked Data_, i.e. every piece of data gets its own HTTP URL on the Web, and we use those URLs to refer to this data.
* When data is stored in someone's pod, they control who and what can access it.
* I will demonstrate this later

(*) Pod: a usually protective container or housing (from the Webster dictionary).

---

### The Solid Pod continued

* HTTP server
  * Request/Response with HTTP methods and codes
  * Should use Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* URI
* Storage
  * RESTful hierarchy
  * Representation and behaviour follows Linked Data Platform Basic Container (LDP-BC)

## The Solid Servers

1. **Node Solid Server (NSS):** _Open Source_ server by the MIT Solid team since 2016. NSS instances in the next slide.
2. **Enterprise Solid Server (ESS):** inrupt's commercial _Closed Source_ alternative, based on [Trellis](https://www.trellisldp.org/). Launched in November 2020. [Article](https://sdtimes.com/data/inrupt-launches-enterprise-solid-server-to-restore-trust-in-data/).
3. **Community Solid Server (CSS):** _Open Source_  project by Ghent University, paid for by inrupt, to rewrite NSS from scratch in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
5. **php-solid-server (PSS):** _Open Source_, good test results, under dev. The basis for the Nextcloud app that makes Nextcloud compatible with Solid.

## Solid servers' interfaces

* All Solid servers have the same common interface, so they donâ€™t need to know anything about what apps are being run on them. See [more here](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod#get-a-pod-from-a-pod-provider)

* Two public demo/test sites for making your own pod. They both run NSS:
    * [inrupt.net](https://inrupt.net/) run by inrupt, hosted at inrupt  premises, USA, data in Amazon Web Services.
    * [solidcommunity.net](https://solidcommunity.net) run by the Solid organisation, hosted in the UK, data in Digital Ocean.
    * a few others people show at the [monthly Solid World Webinar](https://solidproject.org/events).

## How to Login/Register with a Solid Pod

1. Pick a provider: solidcommunity.net* or inrupt.net**
2. Register with **username\*\*\*, password, name, email address**
3. Log in using the newly created WebID with username and password
4. Go to https://podbrowser.inrupt.com/ and log in

*Hosted: \*DigitalOcean (UK) , \*\*AWS (USA)*
*WebID: \*\*\*username will be part of your WebID*

## Solid specifications

Recently matured, they cover areas of:
    * Authentication
    * Authorisation
    * Data inter-operability
    * Testing suites

As the **Web Access Control (WAC)** gives all privileges to the user,
**Access Control Policies (ACP)** are now being defined to assist newcomers.
*Specs' current location:* https://solid.github.io/specification/
*Specs' future location:* https://solidproject.org/TR/
*Test suite:* https://github.com/solid/test-suite

## Solid implementations

By start-up companies and government agencies. Most engaged countries, so far, are Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.
* **Content on the german activities needed here**
* UK NHS (National Health System)
* Flanders' government applications
* Belgian [Digita](https://www.digita.ai/) [inox](https://www.inox.app/) (connects your different pods)
* inrupt developments - [sign-up and play](https://signup.pod.inrupt.com/)

Activities summarised in the [Solid newsletter](https://solidproject.org/newsletter) and reported at the [monthly Solid World Webinar](https://solidproject.org/events).

## The CERN-Solid code investigation project

1. **Review Solid specifications**
2. **Evaluate Solid implementations**
3. **Enrich Indico with Solid principles**
4. Recommendations on Solid adoption in CERN applications
5. Document challenges, advantages, gaps
6. Presentation of proceedings

## Conclusion

The success of the [CERN-Solid code investigation project](https://it-student-projects.web.cern.ch/projects/cern-solid-code-investigation) is important:

1. For Jan's MSc thesis at itu.dk to demonstrate that the implementation works.
2. For CERN to be inspired by the PoC and embrace Solid.
    * Solid is there to stay. We should embark now!
4. For Solid to show that its principles can work in an environment of tens of thousands of users.
