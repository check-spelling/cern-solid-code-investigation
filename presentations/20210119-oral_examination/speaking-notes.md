# Speaking Notes

## Solid

* Solid (Social Linked Data) is a project that was announced by TimBL in 2016. It aims at giving back the ownership of data to the users, who created the data in the first place. It does so by decentralizing the Web.
* Meaning data is stored in so called pods, where the owner of the pod has full control over.
* They decide what pod provider to use, who gets access to the data, and the true source is owned by them.
* Solid is a set of specifications/protocols that define the technologies needed to make this operational, just like with the original Web, created based of standards like HTTP, HTML, and URI.
