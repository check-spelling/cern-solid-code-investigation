# Speaking notes

## 1 Cover

* Introduce yourself
* The Project
* Maria, CERN-Solid collaboration manager
* Contacted me, made project fit, supervisor from CERN

## 2 Overview

* The context, why interest
* One software system
* Show defined scope and approach

## 3 Intro

* Code investigation, what exactly am I going to do?
* Try to integrate the Solid principles in open source software from CERN.
* Meaning, where appropriate the user can decided where to store data.

## 4 Getting Started

* Birthplace of Web, always interest in evolution of the Web
* CERN has many software products
  * that are open
  * operational status with 10s of 1000s of users

## 5 Indico

* One is Indico
* Open source tool
* Over 20 years of production.
* Its resilience and reliability make it attractive for research
* No incentives for user data
  * Conference registration
  * Comment section on meetings

## 6 Interface

* We use it every day

## 7 Project Scope

* Planned roadmap for the success of this project
* Focus on the first three points
* Review of specification
  * What is it? What is it not?
  * What is the current state and how complete is it?
  * How can I make sure that what I implement today passes the test-suite tomorrow
* Secondly, implementations
  * What is there?
  * How do they compare?
  * What is a good recipe for building client-side and server-side application for Solid?
& Thirdly, enrichments
  * How could the briefly mentioned features be implemented?

## 8 Review

* Started with Solid, read specs, frankly adventure
* Because work in progress
* It's fine, even exciting
* Shows in the beginning of the journey, everyone can have impact
* Also, comes with frustration, they come more from the complexity of it
* Make more approachable beneficial

## 9 Enrichments

* Looks like this

## 10 Plugin

* What I am doing now

## 11 Desired

* What I want

## 12 Conclusion

* CERN be inspired by PoC
  * Use CSS/NSS on their infrastructure
  * Build modules with Solid principles in mind
  * Early adopter
  * embrace Solid
  * and actively participate in Solid development
  * to help shape the next step of the Web.
