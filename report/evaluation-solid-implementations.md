# Evaluation of Existing Solid Implementations

The ecosystem of Solid is already diverse in existing implemenetations. Attempts of developing the Solid specifications into software have been carried out with different programming languages and to different completion levels.
These servers or data pods have different goals in mind and even though a server needs to adhere to the specifications it does not make the same.
In the following, three different servers which are closely developed and maintained from the Solid community shall be looked at.
In the second part of this section, libraries for development in the ecosystem and actual developed client applications will be evaluated.

## Solid Servers

<!-- Notes

* Different flavors exist because Solid is a standard

### Node Solid Server

### Community Solid Server

The Community Solid Server (CSS) is the from the Solid community driven development of a new open-source software to provide a way of everyone being able to host a data pod.
It aims at giving developers the opportunity to create new Solid apps and also test them against a working implementation of the Solid specifications.

Another key feature of CSS is its modular architecture. Because Solid is just in the beginning and there is still a lot of different ideas and a roadmap full of features for the future, CSS tries to enable by high cohesion and loose coupling in its modules a highly flexible platform for easy integration of experiments and new ideas.
This has been a problem with NSS, as it was the initial starting implementation of the Solid idea it evolved other years and was used to realize new ideas without a clear idea of how to plug the experiments in and out.
