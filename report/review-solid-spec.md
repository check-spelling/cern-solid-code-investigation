# Review of the Solid specifications

The Solid Ecosystem is specification document describing exactly how the different parts of the Solid Ecosystem should behave.
The specification is currently still in work in progress status, meaning that a lot of section have not been defined and written down. This makes reviewing the specification more difficult, as – even though the general direction of the document will most likely not be changed – it is subject to additions and changes in the future.
Therefore, it shall be reviewed and assessed as is and not so much focussed and speculated on the missing sections.
