# Review of the Solid specifications

The [Solid Ecosystem](https://solid.github.io/specification/) is a publication that outlines all technical and non-technical parts of the Solid ecosystem. It does so in the form of specifications which define their correct means of implementation to ensure the proper usage of the Solid idea.

TODO: *With the specifications Solid is being described in the abstract of the main specification as: "[…] applications with secure and permissioned access to externally stored data in an interoperable way".*

The specifications are currently still work in progress, meaning that a lot of sections are undefined and new work is being merged into the main document on an irregular weekly basis. Contributions to the specifications are heavily discussed using the GitHub issue and pull request features. A review of such a contribution follows strict regulations and is encouraged to come with a sophisticated explanation on why this change is appropriate. Each topic within the specifications have editors to them assigned. A few example topics are:

* Resource Access
* Authentication
* Data Interoperability
* …

This makes reviewing the specification more difficult, as – even though the general direction of the document will remain as is – it is subject to additions and changes in the future.
Therefore, it shall be reviewed and assessed in its current state and no speculations on the missing sections be done.
