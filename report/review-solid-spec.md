# Review of the Solid specifications

The [Solid Ecosystem](https://solid.github.io/specification/) is a publication that outlines all technical and non-technical parts of the Solid Ecosystem. It does so in the form of specifications which define their correct means of implementation to ensure the proper usage of the Solid idea.

TODO: *With the specifications Solid is being described in the abstract of the main specification as: "[…] applications with secure and permissioned access to externally stored data in an interoperable way".*

The specifications are currently published as an incomplete draft, meaning that a lot of sections are undefined and new work is being merged into the documents on an irregular basis.\
Contributions to the specifications are heavily discussed using the GitHub issue and pull request features. A review of such a contribution follows strict regulations. A contribution is encouraged to come with a sophisticated explanation on why this change is appropriate. Each topic within the specifications have editors to them assigned. A few example topics are:

* Resource Access
* Authentication
* Data Interoperability
* …

Due to the fact that the specifications are still work in progress makes reviewing challenging, as – even though the general direction of the document will remain as is – it is subject to additions, removals and general changes in the future.
Therefore, it shall be reviewed and assessed in its current state and no speculations on the missing sections be done.

The main document brings together a set of specifications, either specifications that coin new terms and are being devised at the same time or it reuses existing technical reports by linking to it – mostly being Request for Comments (RFC).
